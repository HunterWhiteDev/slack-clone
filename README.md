### Notice: You need to get the Firebase API keys from me. Email me at hunter.white1801@gmail.com

Not having API keys will result in the app loading a blank screen and/or errors.

# Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. run `npm install`.
2. In `src/firebaseKeys.ts` add the keys I gave you.
3. run `npm start`.
